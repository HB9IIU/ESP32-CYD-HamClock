## ⚙️ Configuration

Before first upload, edit `config.h` to include your Wi-Fi and weather API key:

```cpp
#define WIFI_SSID      "YourWiFi"
#define WIFI_PASSWORD  "YourPassword"
#define WEATHER_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

> These are fallback values. The system saves user changes to SPIFFS as `/settings.json`.

upload_port = hamclock.local  # or use the IP address
```

### 2. Upload firmware
```bash
pio run --target upload
```

### 3. Upload SPIFFS
```bash
pio run --target uploadfs
